## AI-Decision-Assistant

This project implements a commuting options suggestion system using propositional logic, evaluating methods based on conditions like weather, traffic, and appointments.

## Overview

The system suggests one of the following commuting options:
- Work from Home (WFH)
- Drive to work
- Take Public Transport

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python and the `sympy` library. Install `sympy` using pip:

bash
pip install sympy

## How to Run the Python Code

Clone or Download the Repository:

## Code Explanation
The code includes:

Conditions affecting commuting decisions.
Rules for suggesting commuting options using propositional logic.
Functions to query options and evaluate scenarios based on current conditions.

## Future Improvements
Add more nuanced commuting rules.
Implement a user interface for dynamic condition input.
Consider complex commuting strategies.
