# AI-Decision-Assistant

## Overview
This project simulates AI-based decision-making for commuting using propositional logic. The AI assistant evaluates various conditions, such as weather, traffic, and appointments, to suggest the best commuting option: Work From Home (WFH), Drive, or Take Public Transport.

## Features
- **Propositional Logic**: The assistant uses logical rules to determine the best commuting option based on current conditions.
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: The assistant can evaluate different scenarios based on input conditions and provide suggestions accordingly.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add more rules or conditions to improve decision-making capabilities.

## How to Run the Python Code

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have a Git client, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
