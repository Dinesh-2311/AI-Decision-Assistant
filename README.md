# AI-Decision-Assistant

## Overview
This project simulates AI-based decision-making for commuting using propositional logic. The AI assistant evaluates various conditions, such as weather, traffic, and appointments, to suggest the best commuting option: Work From Home (WFH), Drive, or Take Public Transport.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Sympy Library (`pip install sympy`)
  
## Features
- **Propositional Logic**: The assistant uses logical rules to determine the best commuting option based on current conditions.
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: The assistant can evaluate different scenarios based on input conditions and provide suggestions accordingly.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add more rules or conditions to improve decision-making capabilities.

## Usage
1. **Define the Conditions**: Modify the conditions in the scenarios to represent the current situation (e.g., whether it’s raining, if there’s a strike, etc.).
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to see the suggested commuting options based on the defined conditions.

## Running the Program
To run the program, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python commute_decision.py
